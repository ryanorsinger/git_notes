Version Control System
Rational: we have lots of file with lots of changes, with code every character matters. Track our changes, line by line in a permanent record system

Vocabulary:
git - version control system, created by linux maintainers 
repository (repo) -> a directory tracked by git (git enabled directory)
local repo -> laptop
remote repo -> GitHub, on a production server
commit -> snapshot in time w/ changes, w/ timestamp

Mindset and approach:
If your work aint checked into version control (github), it doesn't exist
Add, commit, push every day
Don't worry about pushing complete, perfect work (backed up > perfect)
Write your commit messages to tell a story

## Every Day Workflow
- Every day, we'll:
    - Do work (add, modify, or delete files or lines in files)
    - git add filename.py or git add -A (to add everything)
    - git commit -m "what is this change and why are you doing it"
    - git push
